          <h3>Chicken</h3>
          <p>Chickens farmed for meat are called <b>broilers</b>. Chickens will naturally live for six or more years, but broiler breeds typically take less than six weeks to reach slaughter size. A free range or organic broiler will usually be slaughtered at about 14 weeks of age.<br>
          <br>
          Chickens farmed primarily for eggs are called <b>layer hens</b>. In total, the UK alone consumes more than 34 million eggs per day. Some hen breeds can produce over 300 eggs per year, with "the highest authenticated rate of egg laying being 371 eggs in 364 days". After 12 months of laying, the commercial hen's egg-laying ability starts to decline to the point where the flock is commercially unviable. Hens, particularly from battery cage systems, are sometimes infirm or have lost a significant amount of their feathers, and their life expectancy has been reduced from around seven years to less than two years. In the UK and Europe, laying hens are then slaughtered and used in processed foods or sold as <b>"soup hens"</b>. In some other countries, flocks are sometimes force moulted, rather than being slaughtered, to re-invigorate egg-laying. This involves complete withdrawal of food (and sometimes water) for 7–14 days or sufficiently long to cause a body weight loss of 25 to 35%,or up to 28 days under experimental conditions.</p><br>

          <h3>Beef</h3>
          <p>Beef is the culinary name for meat from cattle, particularly skeletal muscle. Humans have been eating beef since prehistoric times. Beef is a source of protein and nutrients.<br>
          <br>
          Most <b>beef skeletal muscle meat</b> can be used as is by merely cutting into certain parts, such as roasts, short ribs or steak (filet mignon, sirloin steak, rump steak, rib steak, rib eye steak, hanger steak, etc.), while other cuts are processed (corned beef or beef jerky). <b>Trimmings</b>, on the other hand, are usually mixed with meat from older, leaner (therefore tougher) cattle, are ground, minced or used in sausages. The blood is used in some varieties called <b>blood sausage</b>. Other parts that are eaten include other muscles and offal, such as the oxtail, liver, tongue, tripe from the reticulum or rumen, glands (particularly the pancreas and thymus, referred to as sweetbread), the heart, the brain (although forbidden where there is a danger of bovine spongiform encephalopathy, BSE, commonly referred to as mad cow disease), the kidneys, and the tender testicles of the bull (known in the United States as calf fries, prairie oysters, or Rocky Mountain oysters). Some intestines are cooked and eaten as is, but are more often cleaned and used as natural sausage casings. The bones are used for making beef stock. Meat from younger cows (calves) is called <b>veal</b>.</p><br>

          <h3>Sushi</h3>
          <p>I love sushi, but to be honest, my taste in sushi is, admittedly, pretty pedestrian. It tends to run more casual than fancy and when we’re in Tokyo, we’ve been known to eat depachika (department store)/supermarket sushi and more relaxed sushi places like kaiten (conveyor belt) and small family run places. But, one can only eat so many discounted pieces of tuna nigiri before one starts wondering, what’s it like to eat high end Tokyo sushi? <br>
          <br>  
          Like most everyone I know, I have watched <b>Jiro Dreams of Sushi</b>. Back in 2011, I even dreamed about eating at Jiro. But then, after a bit of internet research, I realized that there were a bunch of hoops to jump through for a chance to sit at that coveted counter for 30 minutes. Still, the lure of a high end hinoki wood sushi bar called to me and it would have been a shame to not try out at least one place (or two). As for Jiro, I quickly forgot about him — there are so many other sushi chefs that are move beloved.<br> 
          <br> 
          All you have to do is take a look at <b>tabelog</b>, the definitive guide on where to eat in Japan. Like yelp, tabelog is crowd-sourced. Unlike yelp, you can actually trust it.</p><br>
